# Phaser-CE/2 and Webpack v5
Template project for Phacer-CE (prev phaser-2) and Webpack v5

This is an adaptation for Phaser-2 of this template How to [Setup Phaser 3 with Webpack 4 and Babel](https://saricden.github.io/how-to-setup-phaser3-with-webpack4-and-babel) using the expose-loader as in the case of the original template.

If you try to use the originally published template or another one with Webpack-v4, various **high and critical security alerts** appear because of certain vulnerable dependencies

Migrating to latest Webpack v5 and you get rid of that dependencies
